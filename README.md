Machine Learning Engineer Python: This is a little repo that helps me to get fluent in python. It's basically a robot that gives you one questions after another that you have to solve in a specific time. You can choose your difficulty, see your progress (score) over time, and create new questions in the python_questions.txt. There is no mechanism to check if your answers are correct. The goal is simply to write fast code. The logic here is, that if you know how to solve the questions, it is not important if the answer is bug free as long as you are sure how to code it. If you do not know the answer to some questions, just google it and make a note somewhere that you don't forget it. Then, if the question pops up a second time, you can solve it quickly. Right now, there are not a lot of questions, but coding consists mostly of the same repeating things, so I will build up the question stack over time and expect to have covert the most there is to know in about 1000 questions. Happy coding.</td>
